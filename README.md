## About Me

Currently, I am a student at The University of Iowa double majoring in Finance and Business Analytics & Information Systems. I hope to use my profile to showcase my technical skills as an analyst. I am familiar with Python, Excel, FactSet, SQL, Regression Analysis, and the optimization of business processes. After college, I hope to go into a career utilizing both my financial and analytical skills.
